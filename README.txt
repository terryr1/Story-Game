A story based platforming game.
Coded using unity.
=======
This is animator project I created along with my partner for an Object Oriented Design class.
It takes a text file encoded as an animation using the general format:

For shapes:
shape shapeName shapePosition shapeDimensions shapeColor timeOfAppearence
For animations on the shapes:
animation ShapeName animationTo animationFrom

Refer to the demoTextFiles folder for specific animation examples. 
To use the jar file use the following commands:
-if InputFilePath -iv ViewType (Choose from: text, view, interactive, svg) 
-o OutputFilePath -speed SpeedOfAnimation

The interactive view includes ways to manipulate the
animation in real time.

Here's an example of running the jar file using the command line:
java -jar AnimatorProject.jar -if demoTextFiles/buildings.txt -iv interactive
